# CarService

Hello everyone!

This is my second website, and it incorporates additional technologies like a database, Django, and future Telegram Bot notifications.

Site Structure:
  There are two types of users: "client" (default) and "mechanic" (with additional permissions).

  For clients:
    Ð¡lients can access guides.
    They can edit their profiles.
    Clients can place orders.
  
  For mechanics:
    Mechanics have control over client orders.
    They can request equipment.
  
  Both sites have similar designs, but clients do not have access to the service section.

Next major step is to create a function that will inform a client about their order.
Small steps - optimizing code, adding more static content to HTML, and continuing to create tests.
